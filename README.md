# Unearthed Webapp

**Find reporting for detectorists in Norway**

A prototype web application developed by **Kodeklubben Sandsli** for the 2025 First Lego League competition.

## About

This app simplifies the find reporting procedure in Norway by allowing detectorists to fill out the required form while still in the field. Currently, the official procedure requires filling out a PDF form and submitting it — a process that can be cumbersome when you're out exploring.

## Features

- **Field-accessible** — Use the app directly from your phone while on location
- **GPS location** — Automatically uses your phone's GPS to pinpoint the find location
- **Map interface** — Point and click on a map to set location manually
- **Address lookup** — Automatically looks up the nearest address and corresponding *Gårds- og bruksnummer* (property identification)
- **Reusable finder info** — Your personal information is remembered for future reports
- **Photo upload** — Attach photos that are combined with the filled PDF form into a single document
- **Editable output** — The generated PDF can be further edited on handheld devices or a computer

## Privacy

**No user data is stored on the server.** The app runs entirely in your browser and simply helps you complete the PDF form locally.
